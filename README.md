# Monster-Battle
A recreation of pokemon's battle scene concept.

User would have 4 different attacks to choose from, with each having their own range of damage and accuracy. The user also has 3 different buffs that can either help them sustain longer in the battle or win the battle more effectively.

Your opponent, David Laid also has his own sets of attacks where he amazes with you his amazing physique!

As you defeat your opponent, the game will progress onto the next stage where the opponent will become stronger than before, with increasing damage, becareful!

Let's see how far you can go!

4. If you have lost the battle, the game will keep track of your highest score and allow you to restart the game without losing track of the high-score

Most challenging process during the making of this game :
Initialization of function callbacks in eventListener, as my line of code expands bigger, I found it tough to keep track of which functions that should be called back, and eventually leaving a lot of holes that has to be reviewed and amended towards the final stages of coding.

One of the more enjoyable process during the making of this game :
With so many different functions that I made, I had to visualise the game process entirely from beginning to the end, and repeat this process multiple times.

Planned future enhancements : 
- Adding of visual effects for the attacks
- Creating a unique character instead of using stock images to set the battle scene
