# Monster-Battle
A recreation of pokemon's battle scene concept.

User would have 4 different attacks to choose from, with each having their own range of damage and accuracy. The user also has 3 different buffs that can either help them sustain longer in the battle or win the battle more effectively.

Your opponent, David Laid also has his own sets of attacks where he amazes with you his amazing physique!

As you defeat your opponent, the game will progress onto the next stage where the opponent will become stronger than before, with increasing damage, becareful!

Let's see how far you can go!
